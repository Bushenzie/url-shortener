### URL Shortener

Made with MERN stack

#### How it works

- Clone the repo
- Download all the dependencies in **base** and **client** folder using `npm install`
- Setup `.env` within **base folder** with `PORT` _(default server port is 5000)_ and `MONGODB_URL` for database connection
- Now just start the **server** and **client** with `npm run dev` or `npm start`

#### TODOs:

- [ ] Frontend styling
- [ ] Variable refactor
